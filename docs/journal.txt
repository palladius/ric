  Copied from: http://buzaz.com/index.php/2010/01/03/how-to-build-a-ruby-gem/

== develop ==

 - edit Rakefile
 - rake -T # for a list
 - rake manifest ; rake build_gemspec

== deploy ==

  # Old docs:

	# Deploy version 1
	rake build && 
	rake release &&
	echo Correctly built and deployed version 1
	
Note that your credentials are in `~/.gem/credentials`. I personally
simlinked them to my personal repo...

# Copied from docs NOW: http://fauna.github.com/fauna/echoe/files/README.html
	Deploying your gem
	To deploy the gem and documentation:

	  # Deploy version 2
	  rake manifest &&
	  rake release &&
	  rake publish_docs &&
	  echo Correctly deployed and documented version 2

		#TODO try also this (v3 not working yet)
		rake deploy

# Its pushed on gemcutter, yay!

== DEBUGGING ==

I have no clue on how to debug it!
Some gems (like 0.9.7) load perfectly ewithout loading rubygems before.
Others (0.10.1) dont load at all with stupid messages.

SIGH.

Somethings I tried:

- always ruby init.rb # on the root

== TESTING ==

Run `rake test` and see what happens.
