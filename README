= Synopsis = 
This is my public repository with icons code and stuff.

Modern life is RUBYish, so am I ;-)

â€˜At the moment, this is a public place where I store shared resources such as icons and stuff.. Lets try to keep it well organized, for DHH sake!


== Usage ==

 gem install riclib
 
Some code to take advantage of my script (are you sure?!?)

 require 'riclib'
 puts(red('This is a red sentence'))
